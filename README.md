# GaussAlgorithm
An implementation of the Gauss Algorithm.

This programm can solve any system of linear equations.

requirements:
- matrix of coefficients must be square
- system must have one unambigous solution

input is done via 3 "*.txt" files:
1. contains only one single integer, which represents the dimension
2. contains the values of the matrix; must contain ~dimension^2~ doubles (or integers)
3. contains the result column; must contain ~dimension~ doubles (or integers)

When adding a custom matrix, overwrite one of the existing file-triples.
Adding your own files is laboriouse.
